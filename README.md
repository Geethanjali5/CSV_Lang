*CSVLang:*

The overall goal of the project CSV Parser Language (CSVLang) is to provide users with a simple, SQL-like, declarative language that allows them to perform various operations on CSV files. This language will enable users to handle common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on CSV files without the need for verbose code or external libraries like Pythonâ€™s csv module or pandas. Unlike Python or pandas, which require installation and setup, CSVLang will work directly without additional dependencies. CSVLang simplifies tasks like selecting rows, filtering data, and merging CSV files into intuitive, single-line commands such as SELECT or MERGE. This declarative language abstracts away the complexity of CSV file manipulation, making it user-friendly for both technical and non-technical users. By focusing on CSV-specific operations, CSVLang offers a lightweight and optimized alternative for data transformation, report generation, and other use cases, allowing users to avoid the overhead and learning curve of external libraries while working directly with CSV data. The project will also involve the development of a Python-based compiler that can interpret the commands written in this new language and execute them efficiently on CSV files.
